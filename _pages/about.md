I am a senior researcher at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. My research integrates microbial ecology, analytical chemistry, and molecular endocrinology to enhance wildlife conservation. Using sequencing, mass spectrometry, and microbiological and endocrinological methods, my work aims to unravel the mechanisms that drive host-microbe interactions while improving overall welfare and reintroduction success of threatened species. <b>Views are my own. </b>

My research interests:
------
1. Linking host fitness to environmentally driven changes in microbiota
2. Examining microbiomes following environmental chemical exposure
3. Rewilding across scalesâ€“microbes as treatment
4. Creating tools for conservation
