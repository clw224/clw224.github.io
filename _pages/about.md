Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am a senior researcher at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. My research integrates microbial ecology, analytical chemistry, and molecular endocrinology to unravel the mechanisms that drive host-microbe interactions while improving overall welfare and reintroduction success of threatened species. <b>Views are my own. </b>

<b>Research areas:</b> Organisms interact through symbioses, from harmful to benign to beneficial, driving evolution for both the host and symbiont. This coevolution occurs on different timescales, with microbiota exhibiting rapid changes (<i>e.g.</i>, host dietary changes shape gut microbiota) compared to long-term changes in animal hosts (<i>e.g.</i>, reduced fitness over generations). Gut microbiota have been implicated in negative outcomes, and their interactions with hosts display these clear differences in evolutionary timescales. This host-symbiont imbalance is observed in comparisons between wild and captive animal populations, mirroring observations in human studies. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how microbes and their functions <i>change</i> over time and between generations and how these changes lead to host effects. Exploring symbiotic relationships like these is critical to elucidate mechanisms of adaptation surrounding host-symbiont homeostasis. With >42,000 species currently under threat of extinction, <1% of these speciesâ€™ microbiomes have been evaluated, it is imperative that we expand our scope beyond human-centric studies to understand the microbial drivers of animal fitness.
