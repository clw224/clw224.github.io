Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am a senior researcher at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. My research integrates microbial ecology, analytical chemistry, and molecular endocrinology to enhance wildlife conservation. Using sequencing, mass spectrometry, and microbiological and endocrinological methods, my work aims to unravel the mechanisms that drive host-microbe interactions while improving overall welfare and reintroduction success of threatened species. <b>Views are my own. </b>

<b>Research areas:</b> Organisms interact through symbioses, from harmful to benign to beneficial, driving evolution for both the host and symbiont. This coevolution occurs on different timescales, with microbiota exhibiting rapid changes (<i>e.g.</i>, host dietary changes shape gut microbiota) compared to long-term changes in animal hosts (<i>e.g.</i>, reduced fitness over generations). Gut microbiota have been implicated in negative outcomes, and their interactions with hosts display these clear differences in evolutionary timescales. This host-symbiont imbalance is observed in comparisons between wild and captive animal populations. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how microbes and their functions change over time and between generations and how these changes lead to host effects. Exploring symbiotic relationships like these is critical to elucidate mechanisms of adaptation surrounding host-symbiont homeostasis. With > 42,000 species currently under threat of extinction, < 1% of these speciesâ€™ microbiomes have been evaluated. In our growing anthropogenic landscape, it is necessary for us to understand the microbial drivers of wildlife fitness.
