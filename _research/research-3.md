title: "Can microbes be used to treat or prevent disease?"
excerpt: "Once we identify important host-microbe interactions, how can we recover keystone microbes to improve host fitness? Microbial biotherapeutics are revolutionizing medicine, and their use is expanding. Microbes have been linked to multiple disease states and have also been used as treatment in humans and animals, such as whole microbiome transfaunation or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), to individual microbiota, like probiotics. Despite their success in improving health outcomes in some cases, the mechanisms that modulate the efficacy of such treatments remain poorly understood. My work aims to develop and understand microbially-derived therapies while conserving diversity across multiple ecological scales, as macro-organisms will benefit from the conservation of the diverse microorganisms and metabolites that coexist with them.

Microbial biotherapeutics are revolutionizing medicine, and their use is expanding. Fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) have been successful in improving health outcomes in some cases, but the mechanisms that modulate the efficacy of such treatments remain poorly understood [1]. Not all diseases may be treatable by transfaunation, as rewilding of whole microbiomes may introduce microorganisms that are not beneficial, but instead detrimental. Therefore, understanding the function of bacterial taxa is necessary to direct precision therapeutic rewilding efforts. To fill this gap, I have begun sampling extensively across individuals to create a biobank that can be used to develop therapeutic treatments to improve host fitness through direct rewilding of microbiota using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), live probiotics, or microbially-derived metabolite bio-therapeutics. Currently, I am working on three different lines of inquiry:

<b> From milk to microbes: developing a milk replacer for African elephants</b>

For some species of hoofstock, hand- and assist-rearing endeavors are largely successful, but for others, such as African elephants (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>),success is limited—especially for young animals. What drives these differences is not well understood. One knowledge gap is our understanding of how milk compositionchanges throughout lactation in a successful species, such as the southern white rhinoceros (<i>Ceratotherium simum simum</i>), compared to elephants. Examining milkwith longitudinal sampling will increase our knowledge of how nutrients in milk vary across lactation but also between these two species. Although this information alone would bevaluable, we know milk is only one component in the successful development of offspring. For example, many species consume their dam’s feces soon after birth, and this has beenobserved in both elephants and rhinos. This behavior helps establish a healthy microbiome which is key to long term health. What is lacking is an understanding of howthis microbial colonization occurs, but also how changing nutrient composition in milk may also interact with gut microbiota to lead to different health outcomes. Together, we willintegrate cutting-edge techniques to evaluate multiple sample types to better understand the role of milk components and microbes in the healthy development of calves of both African elephants and rhinos in managed care through intensive sample collection. Our goal is to use this information to aid in the development of an elephant milk replacer that will enhance hand- and assist-rearing in managed care around the globe.

<b> Fecal microbiota transplants in rhinoceros</b>

Currently, I am working with veterinarians to develop FMT protocols and evaluating their efficacy to treat chronic GI-disease in rhinoceros [2]. Despite the common use of such therapies in livestock, their mechanism of action and long-term effects are poorly understood.

<b> Bacterial augmentation to prevent <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> infection </b>

 I am also working with the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog (<i>Rana muscosa</i>) to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic skin treatments to confer disease resistance to <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (Bd) after reintroduction. In order to do so, we have begun isolating microbes from wild frogs, as well as Bd within wild populations to develop population-specific treatments prior to reintroduction, like probiotic application or immune priming [3].

<b>Overall:</b> I evaluate their efficacy by measuring persistence of inoculation microorganisms and alterations in overall microbiota, metabolites, host-stress, clinical symptoms, and other fitness outcomes. My work aims to develop and understand microbially-derived therapies while conserving diversity across multiple ecological scales, as macro-organisms will benefit from the conservation of the diverse microorganisms and metabolites that coexist with them.
