title: "How do microbiomes respond to environmental chemical exposure?"
excerpt: "Since endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) interface with microbiota within the gut, they can directly target microbiota leading to systemic effects, but microbiota can also influence EDC severity through chemical transformations. One gap in our knowledge is whether microbiota may mitigate the effects of EDC exposure. To better understand the role gut microbiota play in regulating the endocrine system, I integrate multiple disciplines to examine interactions between microbiota and EDCs and their potential to affect endocrine function, a critical step in determining which microbiota are targeted and/or which ones may offer mitigation potential."

<b>Gut microbiota modify environmental chemicals, altering bioavailability</b>

Industrialization and urbanization have led to increased exposure to these environmental chemicals, and are in turn linked to a multitude of adverse health outcomes. Some environmental chemicals are synthetic, including persistent organic pollutants, pesticides, and synthetic pyrethroids, and plasticizers. Yet, some are naturally occurring, like heavy metals that are anthropogenically dispersed or phytoestrogens, whose abundance in nature may be exacerbated by our warming planet. When environmental chemicals come into contact with gut microbiota following ingestion, they can directly target or modify microbiota, leading to reduced bacterial diversity and other systemic effects. Additionally, microbiota can also influence exposure severity through chemical transformations that alter environmental chemical activity [1].

<b>Insight into the microbial mechanisms driving animal fitness</b>

Some environmental chemicals are excellent endocrine disruptors, whereby their structural similarity to hormones can lead to adverse effects either organizational or activational means, but the mechanism of action is not always well understood. For example, Wild-born rhinos do not display lowered fertility when fed a high phytoestrogen diet, but those born in captivity do. Yet, when phytoestrogen consumption is reduced in captive-born animals we have observed increased fertility in some individuals, but not all. We have shown that sensitivity of rhino estrogen receptors to some phytoestrogens varies <i>in vitro</i> [2], but when in combination, as observed <i>in vivo</i>, they elicited varying levels of estrogenicity across profiles <i>in vitro</i>, with one combination of phytoestrogens exhibiting greater estrogenicity than estradiol itself. Additionally, these phytoestrogen profiles strongly correlate to fertility. We also observed phytoestrogen transformation by the gut microbiota <i>in vivo</i> via opportunistically collected serum and feces and <i>in vitro</i> through heavy water incubations and Raman microspectroscopy. These data demonstrate that white rhinos are an informative model, as their phenotype aids in understanding the relationship between phytoestrogens, microbial transformation, endocrine disruption, and reproductive outcomes.

<b>Expected societal impact</b>

This work is uniquely positioned to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through a One Health approach (SDGs). First, we must protect/prevent biodiversity loss and extinction of threatened species (SDG 15). Due to numerous anthropogenic threats, the need for captive wildlife management exists, ranging from assist-rearing offspring who are orphaned or rejected to genetic reservoirs for species facing imminent extinction. For many threatened species, captive-reared offspring destined for release are necessary to recover wild populations. My work examines microbiota and its relationship with host health at this intersection, aimed at examining how microbes relate to reintroduction success and evaluating the potential to enhance these efforts by <i>rewilding</i> microbiota as we <i>rewild</i> species into their natural habitats or better care for them in captivity. With > 42,000 species currently under threat of extinction, < 1% of these species’ microbiomes have been evaluated [4], it is imperative that we expand our scope beyond human-centric studies. Second, the application of the proposed work promotes other sustainability efforts. One example is investigating the mitigation potential of microbiota in reducing severity of pollution/contaminants (SDG 3 & 6). In our growing anthropogenic landscape, EDC exposure is increasing, and unravelling the mechanisms that drive both negative and positive outcomes in hosts will lead to the identification of microorganisms that can mitigate host effects <i>in vivo</i>, or better still, be used in ecosystem wide bioremediation efforts.
