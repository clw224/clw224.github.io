title: "How do changing environmental factors shift microbiota to alter animal fitness?"
excerpt: "The gut microbiome can be shaped by both environmental factors as well as its host's evolutionary history. Factors such as changing diets and/or environments can alter microbiota, sometimes leading to negative outcomes. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how microbes and their functions change over time and between generations and how these changes affects hosts. Exploring symbiotic relationships like these is critical to elucidate mechanisms of adaptation surrounding host-symbiont homeostasis."

<b>Diet and seasonality shape gut microbiome dynamics</b>

Many factors can shape the gut microbiome, including diet. My work on giant and red pandas has characterized how changing dietary preferences relate to shifting microbial communities in pandas [1], and how they may subsequently lead to gastrointestinal disease in captivity [2]. In red pandas, we have characterized the development of a healthy microbiome in cubs through adulthood [3], as well as how season may also relate to changing microbiota [4]. Building from this work, we have also expanded beyond pandas to better understand how how seasonal shifts affect stability and gut microbiome dynamics across the tree of life [4,5].  We highlight how the differences in microbiome richness and network connectivity between different animal species may affect the level of temporal stability in the gut microbiota across the year [5]. 


<b>Transition in and out of captivity is linked to multi-generational shifts in the microbiome that mirror animal health and fitness metrics</b>

While long-term effects of captivity are observed for a number of animals, the transition between <i>in</i> and <i>ex situ</i> and subsequent impacts on fitness are not well understood. In southern white rhinos, we found that microbial extirpation and replacement occurs rapidly after animals enter captivity and alters microbiome activity, as observed through sequencing, targeted and untargeted metabolomics and Raman microspectroscopy [6]. See our poster at ISME18 [here](<https://github.com/clw224/ISME18_Lausanne_SWRadapt/blob/main/ISME18_2022_CLWilliams_Poster.jpg>).

In Pacific pocket mice, we characterized how mice and their microbiomes respond to the environmental pressures of captivity across five generations, finding the microbiome assumes a novel, stable conformation after two to three generations in captivity, and that the flux observed in microbial communities mirrors the flux of mouse weight and reproductive metrics [7]. 
This question also extends beyond the gut system, where our work in mountain yellow-legged frogs also explores how microbiota may be critical for their recovery after reintroduction to the wild. Overall, I aim to understand how the loss of critical keystone microbes as animals adapt to novel conditions and how short-term changes in microbiota and subsequent functional shifts may be used to predict or improve long-term animal fitness.
