title: "What can chemical profiles tell us about animal physiology and health status?"
excerpt: "Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool. Chemical profiling of different biospecimens gives insight into animals at the individual and population level. Our work using both targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry provides dietary readouts, connects host phenotypes to microbial metabolism, as well as identifies individuals and their reproductive state using chemical profiling."

Using both targeted and untargeted metabolomics, chemical profiling of biospecimens provide great insight into animals at the individual and population level. These tools have been powerful at understanding dietary readouts in humans [1] and phenotypes in a broad range of species, such as rhinoceros--linking phytoestrogen-profiles to fertility status of captive-born individuals [2]. We have also used hormone monitoring in endangered amphibians to better understand animal physiology, including pseudohermaphroditism [3] as well as supporting captive breeding efforts more broadly [4,5]. In bears, we have found chemical profiles from the skin of brown bears to display evidence of individuality and age-sex variation across individuals in the wild [6]. For captive giant pandas, we found similar results in urine, as well as identifying impending ovulation [7]. Currently we are analyzing skin swabs broadly across pandas, as well as comparisons to other bear species, including brown bears and polar bears, linking microbial production of pheromones to determine estrus [8]. Altogether, using chemical profiling using mass spectrometry, we can identify physiological state of both wild and captive animals without needing invasive sampling techniques.
