excerpt: 'Anurans can display a host of intriguing sexual syndromes, including hermaphroditism and sex reversal. Using a multifaceted approach for diagnosing and characterising hermaphroditism in the endangered anuran species Rana mucosa, we tracked changes in female reproductive status using hormone monitoring, ultrasound examinations, individual life history, fertilisation records and post-mortem findings. Seven individuals originally sexed as females developed secondary male sexual characteristics, behaviour and hormone profiles and, in some cases, had testicular tissue despite having previously laid eggs. Our results suggest that reproductive technologies can shed light on life history patterns and reproductive anomalies that may affect endangered anuran survival.'
