excerpt: 'The establishment and management of ex situ breeding and assurance populations around the globe are meant to provide short-term solutions to the formidable loss of amphibian diversity presently occurring. Large multi-scaled facilities, such as zoos and aquariums, can provide the infrastructure to safeguard species and populations. However, often even large, economically viable facilities lack the knowledge to efficiently cater to the plethora of environmentally controlled physiological strategies that amphibians possess. Anurans present a class of amphibians that have often been viewed as easy to maintain ex situ. However, while adult survival may be relatively successful it is rarely accompanied by good reproductive output, health, and fitness. Even more conspicuous is the low survivorship of offspring produced <i>ex situ</i> once they are translocated back into the wild. The mountain yellow-legged frog (<i>R. muscosa</i>) ex situ breeding program EBP is a prime example of the challenges that amphibians EBPs face. Although more research is needed, the <i>R. muscosa </i> program has increased reproductive output and health of its colony by incorporating reproductive technologies and strategic genetic management in conjunction with a greater understanding of the species' natural history, to produce and translocate viable animals each year. This paper highlights the EBPs past decade of research featuring the program's contribution to building empirical, multidisciplinary approaches that boost the robustness of an endangered species, by safeguarding existing genetic diversity and maximizing fitness and survival outcomes.'
