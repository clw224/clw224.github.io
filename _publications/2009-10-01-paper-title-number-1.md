title: "Enhancing untargeted metabolomics using metadata-based source annotation"

collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1

excerpt: 'Traditional metabolomics studies annotate approximately 10% of molecular features
for more well-define systems, like human datasets, leaving the vast majority of features
unannotated and thus uninterpretable. In this paper, we introduce a new workflow for untargeted
mass spectrometry analysis to bridge this gap. Using our reference data-driven (RDD) analysis,
we demonstrate how matching tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) to metadata-annotated source
data as a pseudo-MS/MS reference library, we can increase our interpretation of untargeted
datasets. For example, using foods as source data, we can increase spectral usage 5.1-fold
over conventional structural MS/MS library matching. This approach allows for empirical
assessments of diets from untargeted data, generating dietary readouts that can be used to
identify consumption of specific foods or general dietary patterns through curated and ontologyaware
reference data of food sources. Using foods as source data is just one application of this
workflow. Future work aims to create similar RDD datasets, including environmental or microbial
sources, which will be important for understanding environmental chemicals and more broadly
the exposome and their impacts on health.'
